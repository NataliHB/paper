# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region,
but continental scale 
A large uncertentaly in modellig BBOA is the etent to
wich measures in the literature can be applied to regional
scale.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported
away from the soruce region.

# Methodology
We compare our measurements with a model simulation
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2020.

# Results
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominat growth
mechanisms for these particles.
